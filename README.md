-- FEATURES -- 

- Resources: Gold, Wood and Stone.

- Buildings spawn different pieces.

- Multiple actions per turn dictated by how many buildings you have. 

- Stone is mined by creating quarries using the builder piece.
          - (Once mined, quarries will "fall in" making them unable to be occupied. If you continue to mine them they will yield less stone but                           eventually can be cleared, allowing you to place buildings there again. You cannot place another quarry there, though)
