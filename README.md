-- FEATURES -- 

- Resources: Gold, Wood and Stone.

- Buildings spawn different pieces.

- Multiple actions per turn dictated by how many buildings you have. 

- Stone is mined by creating quarries using the builder piece.
          - (Once mined, quarries will "fall in" making them unable to be occupied. If you continue to mine them they will yield less stone but                           eventually can be cleared, allowing you to place buildings there again. You cannot place another quarry there, though)

- Different playstyles require different materials.

- New Pieces such as: Elephant, Unicorn, Monk, Duke, Jester, Builder, Pikeman, Rogue Bishop, Rogue Knight, Rogue Rook, Rogue Pawn, Gold General
          - (Rogue Pieces move onto and through Tree Tiles)

- Adds prayer/ritual system using certain buildings. Some rituals will sacrifice monks.

- Prayer Rituals: Summon Gold General, Smite, Delete Resource, Line Destroy, Create Resource, Swap, Protect, Teleport

- All pieces have a unique use and function. 
         - (For Example: The Jester piece moves like a queen, cannot capture and any piece on any square directly adjacent to him cannot move or act.
