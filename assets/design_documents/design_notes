Server authentication of player events:

Assuming you have a scenario where a client moves its character, consider the following example approach:

    Client Request:
        The client sends a "move" event to the server with information about the intended movement.

    Server Validation:
        The server validates the move, ensuring it is legal and doesn't violate game rules.

    Server Update:
        If the move is valid, the server updates the game state and broadcasts the updated state to all clients,
         including the client that initiated the move.

    Client Update:
        All clients, including the one that initiated the move, receive the server's update and apply it locally.

This way, the server acts as the authoritative source, ensuring fair play and consistency among all connected clients.

In summary, while there might be scenarios where the server echoes events back to the originating client, it's typically
 more common for the server to process and validate client actions and then broadcast authoritative updates to all
  connected clients. The specific approach depends on the requirements and mechanics of your game.
